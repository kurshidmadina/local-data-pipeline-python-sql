# 🌍 Local Data Pipeline Project with Python & SQL

## 🔍 Objective

This project simulates a real-world ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and SQLite. It demonstrates how to:

- Extract data from a public REST API
- Clean and transform the data using Pandas
- Store the processed data in a local SQL database (SQLite)
- Perform SQL queries for insights
- Export final summaries as CSV

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Requests)
- SQLite (`sqlite3` module)
- SQL (basic to intermediate)
- Jupyter (optional)

---

## 🗃️ Data Source

- **API Used:** [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all)
- Data contains information about countries including names, regions, and populations.

---

## ⚙️ Pipeline Steps

1. **Extract**: Fetch data from the REST Countries API using `requests`.
2. **Transform**: Normalize the JSON into a flat table, clean missing values, rename columns, and create calculated fields.
3. **Load**: Store the cleaned data into a local SQLite database table named `countries`.
4. **Analyze**: Run SQL queries to summarize and extract insights (e.g., population by region).
5. **Export**: Save results to a new CSV file for visualization or further analysis.

---

## 🔍 Sample SQL Query

```sql
SELECT region, SUM(population) as total_population
FROM countries
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY total_population DESC;

📊 Output

The final CSV file population_by_region.csv summarizes the population of each region across all countries.
